## About Tutti

Tutti helps you create onboarding expericences like hints and single- or multi-screen tutorials. 

<p align="center">
    <img src ="Resources/Demo.gif" />
</p>

Tutti has different onboarding types. Standard hints and tutorials are shown right away and only once, while other types require multiple presentation attempts, a certain number of "incorrect" actions etc. You can combine various types to create new ones.

You can reset the display state of any onboarding if you want to display it again. Tutti also supports multiple users, so that each onboarding is unique to each user.
